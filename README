Memcached Library for CodeIgniter
=================================

DESCRIPTION
-----------

This library is to help interface between a CodeIgniter based project and 1 or more Memcached Servers ( http://www.danga.com/memcached/ ). It can also be used as a standalone php class with a few tweaks (the data in config/memcached.php needs to be loaded into the $config variable in the constructor).
